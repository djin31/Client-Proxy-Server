# Client-Proxy-Server
A basic example code for establishing a connection for file transfer between a client and a server which can also double up as a proxy

# Usage
First run the script proxyserver.py on all the proxies and the server which we are expecting to occur in the path for a file transfer.
Run the client.py, it accepts the name of file which needs to be fetched from the server along with the ip addresses and port number for all the proxies in between.
An example inputfile has been provided for reference.
